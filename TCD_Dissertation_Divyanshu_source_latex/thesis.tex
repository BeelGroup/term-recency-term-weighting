ABSTRACT

Effectiveness of a recommendation in an Information Retrieval (IR) system is determined by relevancy scores of retrieved results. Term weighting is responsible for computing the relevance scores and consequently differentiating between the terms in a document. However, current term weighting formula like TF-IDF weighs terms only based on term frequency and inverse document frequency irrespective of other important factors. This results in uncertainty in cases when both TF and IDF values are the same for more than one document resulting in same term weight values and hence unable to segregate the terms based on other crucial factors. In this research, we propose a modification of TF-IDF and other term-weighting schemes that weights terms additionally based on the recency of a term, i.e. metric based on the year the term occurred for the first time and the document frequency. We modified the term weighting schemes TF-IDF, BM25 and Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) to additionally consider the recency of a term and evaluated them on three datasets. Our modified TF-IDF outperformed the standard TF-IDF on all three datasets; the improvised USE model outperformed the standard USE on two of the three datasets; the modified BM25 did not perform well against the classic BM25 term-weighting scheme.

The study is based on the study of the time parameter in search relevance and its significance in existing term weighting methodologies. All the existing term weighting approaches calculate term weight based only on the frequency distributions without contemplating the diverse contexts of different terms. With this research, we introduce a term age, which will consider the time-based context for enhancing the search results and recommendations.

Previous studies have focused on different aspects of term weighting like term distribution, the pattern of occurrences, IDF formulation, etc., but none of them has worked on the term age aspect of the terms. There have been some researches, based on time-aware recommendations and user modelling. In this research, we have tried to bunch up these concepts and formulated a new term age formulation and time normalized term weighting schemes.

We have used three different datasets of different domains, that is, news, web answer passages and research paper recommendations. Some set of queries and expected set of results are given for the selected datasets, that are considered as the gold standard for evaluating the performance of different models. 
These different datasets are indexed using Elasticsearch and defining different term weighting schemes to be used. Six different term weighting schemes have been implemented in this research comprising of, two standard methodologies, that is, TF-IDF, BM25, and their respective time normalized variants. And an advanced text embedding model, Universal Sentence Encoder and its time normalized variant.

The problem is formulated as the information retrieval or search problem for the given set of queries. The results retrieved are evaluated in an aggregated form by using precision, recall, F1 and NDCG metrics. In 2 out of 3 algorithms, our term-recency modification improved the performance notably. When measured by p@10, time normalized TF-IDF outperformed TF-IDF by an average 47\% and time normalized USE outperformed USE in 2 of the 3 datasets by average 14.3\% but performed 50\% worse in the other dataset. The time normalized BM25 version, however, performed an average 32\% worse than BM25. NDCG@10 also leads to similar results.
